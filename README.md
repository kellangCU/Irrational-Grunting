CU Color Scheme: https://www.colorado.edu/brand/how-use/color

This project is intended to be an event tracking application for the CU Boulder campus and community. Users will be able to view and save events that are going on on campus as well as create their own events for others to view. We've decided that CU Boulder needs an organized and concise way for students and faculity to figure out what cool events will be taking place on campus, so we have created that solution. Users are able to search for events or scroll through them, as well as view their saved events in a calendar mode.
